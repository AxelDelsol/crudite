# crudite

Personal project to learn more about programming and have fun.
It does not have an ending and new requirements will be added as time goes by.

## Requirements

- [x] Create a small API to manage teas in Python
- [x] Redo it in C# using ASP.NET Core
- [ ] Same in Go
- [ ] Compare implementations

## Learnings / Thoughts

### Create a small API to manage teas in Python

* FastAPI is an interesting web framework that fits between Django and Flask
* Designing / Building the API with TDD is easy but beware of dependencies overrides
* Choosing not to go with a database directly and using an "in memory" store makes it easier to get a working API
* I tried to use the recommended project structure with multiple modules but it was not "comfortable". So I decided to put all my tea related functions and classes in the same file


### Create a small API to manage teas in ASP.NET Core

* Battery included framework like Ruby on Rails or Django
* The documentation is good with lots of example. It is much more mature than FastAPI
* I actually implemented it twice. I first used the scaffolding tool provided by Visual studio. I found it hard to test so I deleted everything and did it my own way.
* I chose not to use mocks despite being the recommended way. I prefer fake implementations as it is much easier to test behavior and not method calls
* Having autogenerated documentation with OpenAPI is really nice. Trying the API from a user perspective is valuable.
